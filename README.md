# ytdlbot

YouTube Download BotðŸš€

Download videos from YouTube and other platforms through a Telegram Bot

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

# Usage

[https://t.me/benny_ytdlbot](https://t.me/benny_ytdlbot)

Send link directly to the bot. Any
platform [supported by youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html) will also work.

## Limitation of my bot

Because I have limited resources, hundreds of Gigabytes doesn't sound like a sustainable solution.

**In that case, I added one limitation: 5GiB per 24 hours for each user. Might change in future**

You can choose to become 'VIP' if you really need large traffic. And also, you could always deploy your own bot.
